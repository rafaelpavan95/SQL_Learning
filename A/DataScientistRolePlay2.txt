Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table;

i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key)) FROM table;

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2463 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
v. Review = 10000 (id), 8090 (business_id), 9581 (user_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 (id), 6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id), 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000 (id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

Yes. When we stratify the review_count column in different groups and calculate the mean of fans for each group, we can see that there is a positive correlation (not strong) between the review_count number and the average number of fans. So as the review_count increases, in average, the number of fans also increases.

SELECT CASE 
    WHEN review_count > 1000 AND review_count <= 2000 THEN '1-2K'
    WHEN review_count > 900 AND review_count <= 1000 THEN '0.9-1K' 
    WHEN review_count > 800 AND review_count <= 900 THEN '0.8-0.9K' 
    WHEN review_count > 700 AND review_count <= 800 THEN '0.7-0.8K'
    WHEN review_count > 600 AND review_count <= 700 THEN '0.6-0.7K'
    WHEN review_count > 500 AND review_count <= 600 THEN '0.5-0.6K'
    WHEN review_count > 400 AND review_count <= 500 THEN '0.4-0.5K'
    WHEN review_count > 300 AND review_count <= 400 THEN '0.3-0.4K'
    WHEN review_count > 200 AND review_count <= 300 THEN '0.2-0.3K'
    WHEN review_count > 100 AND review_count <= 200 THEN '0.1-0.2K'
    WHEN review_count >= 0 AND review_count <= 100 THEN '0-0.1K'
    END AS INDICATOR,
    SUM(fans)
    FROM user GROUP BY INDICATOR


+-----------+----------------+
| INDICATOR |      AVG(fans) |
+-----------+----------------+
| 0-0.1K    | 0.436788874842 |
| 0.1-0.2K  |  8.93333333333 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, there are two different cases for Las Vegas in ‘Food’ category: one with 4 stars and other with 2.5 stars. The first is open from 10:00 to 19:00 and the second is open from 8:00 to 22:00. 

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes, the one with 4 stars has 30 reviews and the other with 2.5 stars has only 6 reviews.         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.


Although the fact that the sample size is too small, we can see that the 4 stars business is located at South and 2.5 stars business at East. Maybe at South there are more restaurants and consumers, what can justify the difference in reviews number.



SQL code used for analysis:


SELECT B.stars, B.review_count, C.category, H.hours, B.address
FROM Business B 
JOIN Category C ON B.id = C.business_id 
JOIN hours H ON H.business_id = B.id
WHERE B.city = 'Las Vegas' AND C.category = 'Food'


+-------+--------------+----------+-----------------------+-----------------------------+
| stars | review_count | category | hours                 | address                     |

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

The business that are open have a higher average in stars than the closed business. (3.679 x 3.5203)
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
The business that are open have a higher average in review_count than the closed business. (31 x 23)

+---------------------+---------+-------------------+---------------+

         
         
SQL code used for analysis:


SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)), is_open, AVG(review_count), AVG(stars)
FROM Business  
GROUP BY is_open;

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         

Understanding the viability of opening and running business related with food segment in a specific city/state/location.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           

In order to understand where to open and how to run a food business, we would need data about: address, city, state, neighborhood, postal code, average star rating, average review count, category,  working hours during weekdays and weekends, attributes of the business and if the business still open or not. Using descriptive statistics we can find patterns that can explain the success or the failure of the business and use this information to enhance the performance and make a good choice for the category and location of the investment.

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
